# Ideas

## Groups

e.g. Glen Oaks church of Christ

## Friends

Not random strangers. Send friend requests to people in groups or people you know.

## Mailing list ( need better name )

A collection of individuals from friends or groups that have some kind of semantic meaning to you. e.g. "parents", "elders". Think of it as a short cut to send a request to multiple people like a mailing list.

## Prayer Request (Prayer Topic?)

Request can be shared with an individual from groups or from your group. Request can also be sent to entire groups.

See the history of a prayer request?
* status over time
* number of prayers over time?
* something similar to a github issue?

Define what time of prayer is being requested.
* Thanksgiving - e.g. My brother has come back to the faith
* Supplication - e.g. Open the door for Alan to preach the gospel

Allow people to extend (share) the request to another group they belong to. Like forwarding an email.

## Prayer Responses

Responses are anonymous by default but can be marked to display who prayed for the topic

## Subscribe to Requests

Subscribe to a prayer request to optionaly get notifications. Curate a list of current unresolved requests so you know who/what to pray for.

Subscribe to all requests from a group?

## Tags  ( denoted with # )

Ability to tag requests with different categories. e.g. love, baptism, racism, hope, illness

## Reference ( denoted with @ )

Ability to reference people or groups

## Search

Search for prayer requests by reference or by tag within your groups

## Scenario 1

A chruch forms a group. Invites all members to join. The church group creates prayer requests regarding their congregation. Sick, fallen away, preachers they support, recent baptisms etc. Members then subscribe to any/all requests they are interested in.Members can setup notifications at a user defined cadence. Daily, weekly, time of day, etc. Members click the notification to be taken to their curated list of prayer topics. After praying they can "respond" to the pryaer üôè. Similar to "liking" a post on facebook.
